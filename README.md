# Data Classification Using AI

## Description

This is a basic AI-based data classification project developed as **Project 2** for the **DecodeLabs Industrial Training Kit - Batch 2026**.

The project uses the **Iris dataset** and a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification model to classify flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Features

* Uses the built-in Iris dataset
* Loads and analyzes the dataset
* Splits data into training and testing sets
* Uses feature scaling with StandardScaler
* Finds the optimal K value for KNN
* Trains a KNN classification model
* Predicts flower species
* Calculates accuracy and F1 score
* Generates a confusion matrix
* Generates a K tuning curve
* Predicts the species of a new flower

## Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* StandardScaler

## How to Run

1. Install Python on your computer.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

4. Open Command Prompt or Terminal in the project folder.
5. Run the following command:

```bash
python project2.py
```

6. The program will display the dataset information, model results, accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, and prediction.

## Example

```text
STEP 1: DATASET OVERVIEW

Samples: 150, Features: 4, Classes: 3

STEP 2: TRAIN-TEST SPLIT

Training samples: 120
Testing samples: 30

STEP 3: FEATURE SCALING

Post-scaling train mean (~0): [0. 0. 0. 0.]
Post-scaling train std  (~1): [1. 1. 1. 1.]

STEP 4: CHOOSING K

Optimal K found: ...

STEP 6: OUTPUT VALIDATION

Accuracy: ...
F1 Score (macro avg): ...

STEP 7: PREDICTION ON NEW DATA

New sample [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]] -> Predicted species: setosa
```

## Output Files

The project generates two graph files:
